### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It
is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1 t/e`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UpdatedUIClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EntryPane`
, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Entry` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `PennyWiseParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is
   executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a entry).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1 t/e` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `PennyWiseParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `PennyWiseParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the application data i.e., all `Entry` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEntryList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Entry` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Entry>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both application data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `PennyWiseStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Summarise Entries

The `summary` command is implemented by the `SummaryCommandParser` and `SummaryCommand` classes

`SummaryCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the parameter received from the user

`SummaryCommand` class is responsible for generating the summary statistic for the specified duration

Below is a sequence diagram and explanation of how the SummaryCommand is executed.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `summary mo/08-2022` Command](images/SummarySequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1.The user enters `summary mo/08-2022` command in the main window

Step 2. The command is handled by `LogicManager#execute` method,
which then calls the `PennyWiseParser#parseCommand` method

Step 3. The `PennyWiseParser` matches the word summary in the string and extracts the argument string `mo/08-2022`

Step 4. The `PennyWiseParser` then calls `SummaryCommandParser#parse` method
and the argument string is converted to a List

Step 5. The `SummaryCommandParser` creates a new MonthPredicate instance to handle the filter

Step 6. The `SummaryCommandParser` creates a new `SummaryCommand` instance with the `MonthPredicate` instance and
returns it to `PennyWiseParser`, which in turn returns to `LogicManger`.

Step 7. The `LogicManager` calls the `SummaryCommand#execute` method.

Step 8. The `SummaryCommand` calls the `Model#updateFilteredEntry` method and
filters the income and expenditure entries by the month

Step 9. The application calculates the summary statistics for the filtered income and expenditure entries.

Step 10. The `SummaryCommand` then creates a CommandResult and returns it to `LogicManager`.

#### Design considerations:
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only allow users to generate summary statistic either by month or all entries
  * Pros: Easier to implement. The statistics by month is also logical as
  users will generally budget based on a monthly basis
  * Cons: Users will not be able to customise the scope of the summary
  statistic further (e.g summarising entries for the past week)

* **Alternative 2:** Provide the option to specify a start and end date to generate summary statistic
  * Pros: Allows more customisation to the scope of the summary statistics
  * Cons: Harder to implement and the command will be more complex as it will require more parameters

### Add Entry

The `add` command is implemented by the `AddCommandParser` and `AddCommand` classes.

`AddCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the parameter received from the user.

`AddCommand` class is responsible for adding a new entry to the specified list.

Below is a sequence diagram and explanation of how the AddCommand is executed.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add t/e d/Lunch a/7.20 da/04-10-2022 c/Food` Command](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user enters `add t/e d/Lunch a/7.20 da/04-10-2022 c/Food` command in the main window.

Step 2. The command is handled by `LogicManager#execute` method, which then calls the `PennyWiseParser#parseCommand`method.

Step 3. The `PennyWiseParser` matches the entry details in the string and extracts the argument string `t/e d/Lunch a/7.20 da/04-10-2022 c/Food`.

Step 4. The `PennyWiseParser` then calls `AddCommandParser#parse` method and the argument string is converted to a List.

Step 5. The `AddCommandParser` then creates a new instances of arguments needed for an Entry: `EntryType`, `Description`, `Amount`, `Date`, `Category`.

Step 6. The `AddCommandParser` uses the new instances to create a new instance of `Entry`, depending on the `EntryType` specified.

Step 7. The `AddCommandParser` creates a new `AddCommand` instance with the new `Entry` instance and returns it to `PennyWiseParser`, which in turns returns to `LogicManager`.

Step 8. The `LogicManager` calls the `AddCommand#execute` method.

Step 9. The `AddCommand` calls the `Model#addExpenditure` or `Model#addIncome` method and adds the new entry to the specified list.

Step 10. The `AddCommand` then creates a `CommandResult` instance and returns it to `LogicManager`.

#### Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only allow users to create an Entry with 1 type of category
  * Pros: Users are able to distinctly sort their entries into specific pre-determined categories.
  * Cons: Users would not be able to specify entries under their own categories.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow users to specify their own categories.
  * Pros: Users can be more flexible in grouping their spending/incomes.
  * Cons: Possible dilution of categories, which would make the PieChart diagram not as useful.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedPennyWise`. It extends `PennyWise` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `pennyWiseStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedPennyWise#commit()` â€” Saves the current PennyWise state in its history.
* `VersionedPennyWise#undo()` â€” Restores the previous PennyWise state from its history.
* `VersionedPennyWise#redo()` â€” Restores a previously undone PennyWise state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitPennyWise()`, `Model#undoPennyWise()`
and `Model#redoPennyWise()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedPennyWise` will be initialized with the
initial PennyWise state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single PennyWise state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th entry in the application. The `delete` command
calls `Model#commitPennyWise()`, causing the modified state of the application after the `delete 5` command executes
to be saved in the `pennyWiseStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted PennyWise
state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add t/e â€¦â€‹` to add a new entry. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitPennyWise()`
, causing another modified PennyWise state to be saved into the `pennyWiseStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitPennyWise()`, so the application state will not be saved into the `pennyWiseStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the entry was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoPennyWise()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous application state, and restores the application to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial PennyWise state, then there are no previous PennyWise states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoPennyWise()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite â€” it calls `Model#redoPennyWise()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the application to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `pennyWiseStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest PennyWise state, then there are no undone PennyWise states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoPennyWise()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 5. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitPennyWise()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `pennyWiseStateList`, all application states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add t/e â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire penny wise.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the entry being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### [Proposed\] Pie Chart View feature

#### Implementation
The pie chart view feature displays a pie chart view by categories of spending/income entries, and can be accessed via the `view` command. Additionally, it implements the following operation
* `getExpensePieChartData()`
* `getIncomePieChartData()`

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getExpensePieChartData()`, `Model#getIncomePieChartData()` respectively. 

The activity diagram below shows the workflow when a user executes the `view` command.

![ViewActivityDiagram](images/ViewActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The command syntax for view command is as follows:
view entryType graphType
E.g. `view t/e g/c` indicates type expenses and graph category. This shows a pie chart view of the expenses entries grouped by categories.
</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the pie chart view mechanism behaves at each step.
![PieChartViewSequenceDiagram](images/PieChartViewSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user types in `view t/e g/c` command in the main window. 

Step 2. This command is handled by `MainWindow#executeCommand` method, which then calls the `LogicManager#execute` method

Step 3. `LogicManager` then calls the `pennyWiseParser#parseCommand` method which matches the command word `view` in the string and extracts the arguments string `t/e g/c`.

Step 4. `pennyWiseParser` then calls the `ViewCommandParser#parse` method. In this method, it is ensured that the input is of the correct format, and the entryType and graphType is extracted.

Step 5. `LogicManager`then calls the `ViewCommand#execute` method which returns a `CommandResult` that is returned to `LogicManager` and passed to `MainWindow`.

Step 6. `MainWindow` then calls the `handleGraph` method which determines what data to update before calling `updateGraph`.

Step 7. In `updateGraph`, `LogicManager#getExpensePieChartData` calls `ModelManager#getPieChartData` which returns the pieChartData for the pieChart to be created and rendered on the UI.

Design considerations:
* **Alternative 1(current choice):** The pie chart updates only after `view` command.
    * Pros: Easy to extend since we are adding more graph representation of data later such as bar graphs.
    * Cons: Not responsive to changes in data, for instance if the user adds an entry, the pie chart will not be automatically updated.
* **Alternative 2:** Pie chart updates immediately after changing tabs from expenses and income.
    * Pros: Intuitive, simple and quick for user.
    * Cons: Difficult to extend to other graph types as user might prefer other graph representations.
