**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- All command follow this format:<br>
  <pre>
    command | entry identifier | input | [optional inputs]
  </pre>
  Example: 
  <pre>
    add t/e d/Lunch a/15.60 da/15-08-2022 c/Meal
  </pre>
    - Command : <pre>add</pre><br>
    - Identifier : <pre>t/e</pre><br>
    - Input : <pre>d/Lunch a/15.60 da/15-08-2022 c/Meal</pre><br>
    - Optional input : NIL<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `delete INDEX_OF_ENTRY t/ENTRY_TYPE`, `INDEX_OF_ENTRY` is a parameter which can be used as `delete 10 t/e`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `view t/ENTRY_TYPE [MONTH]` can be used as `view t/e mo/2022-05` or as `view t/e`.

- **ALL** identifiers are <ins>case sensitive</ins>. 
  e.g `d/Lunch` as a descriptor for "Lunch" is accepted by PennyWise, however `D/Lunch` would not be accepted.
</div>

## Before Using

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the application:**<br>
- To familiarise yourself with our user interface, please refer to the following diagram and table to understand how to use our application.

|      `Component`       |                                                       `Explanation`                                                        |
|:----------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|    **List Display**    |            where you view your entry lists (Expenditure or Income) <br> - can be modifed by the `view` command             |
|   **Graph Display**    | where you view your entries in a graphical overview (Pie Chart or Line Graph) <br> - can be modified by the `view` command |
| **Command Input Box**  |                                       where you enter your commands to use PennyWise                                       |
| **Command Output Box** |                                  where you see the output of your commands from PennyWise                                  |

![UserInterfaceExplaination](images/UserInterfaceExplaination.png)

- For **ALL** entries, categories are <ins>COMPULSORY</ins> and every entry can only contain <ins>one</ins> category. 
  The following table shows the`Expenditure` and `Income` entries categories. The category names are <ins>case sensitive</ins>.

|   `Expenditure`   |    `Income`     |
|:-----------------:|:---------------:|
|     **Food**      |   **Salary**    |
|   **Groceries**   |  **Allowance**  |
| **Entertainment** |   **Profit**    |
|   **Education**   | **Investments** |
|    **Housing**    |    **Gifts**    |
|    **Others**     |   **Others**    |

- For **ALL** entries, 2 entries are considered duplicates <ins>IF</ins> both entries have exactly the same:
  `description`, `date` `amount` and `category`. We do not want PennyWise to be managing entries which are a repeat,
  of one another, as it would be easier to simply use the [edit](#editing-entries--edit-index_of_entry-tentry_type-dedited_description-aedited_amount-daedited_date-cedited_category) 
  command to alter the original entry's specifications. <br> <br>
  For example, when executing the following 2 commands one after another, PennyWise will recognise (2), which is the second `Teh Beng` added as a duplicate entry. 
  Having multiple duplicate entries will make it difficult for users to track their expenses later on, and could clutter the list. Having them differentiated will make
  it easier for you to recall what you spent your money on!
  <pre>
    <code>
        1. add t/e d/Teh Beng a/1.50 da/22-10-2022 c/Food
        2. add t/e d/Teh Beng a/1.50 da/22-10-2022 c/Food
    </code>
  </pre>
  To add similar entries, vary the description/amount/date/category to let PennyWise know they are not duplicates!
  <pre>
    <code>
        1. add t/e d/Teh Beng 11am a/1.50 da/22-10-2022 c/Food
        2. add t/e d/Teh Beng 4pm a/1.50 da/22-10-2022 c/Food 
    </code>
  </pre>
  OR we could even edit the original entry directly to reflect 2 cups of `Teh Beng` consumed.
  <pre>
    <code>
        1. edit 1 t/e d/2 Teh Beng 11am a/3.00 da/22-10-2022 c/Food
    </code>
  </pre>
