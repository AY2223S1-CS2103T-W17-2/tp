## Before Using PennyWise

### What is an Entry

Think of PennyWise as a budgeting diary that has infinite number of pages. You can write as much data as you want 
to track your expenditure or income, PennyWise will keep track of them. An entry is what PennyWise terms as a 
particular expenditure or income logged into the application. PennyWise defines an expenditure and income as things that
you spend money on, and things that make you money respectively!

An entry is defined by the following items:

* Type: whether it is an expenditure or income
* Description: what is this particular entry about
* Amount: what was the amount associated with this particular entry
* Date: when was this entry logged in PennyWise
* Category: how this entry is classified

### Familiarising yourself with the interface

To familiarise yourself with our user interface, please refer to the following diagram and table to get comfortable with the application.

![UserInterfaceExplanation](images/ug/UserInterfaceExplanation.png)

|                                       `Component`                                        |                                                       `Explanation`                                                        |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|     ![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=List%20Display&color=862e9c)     |            where you view your entry lists (Expenditure or Income) <br> - can be modified by the `view` command            |
|    ![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=Graph%20Display&color=5c940d)     | where you view your entries in a graphical overview (Pie Chart or Line Graph) <br> - can be modified by the `view` command |
| ![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=Command%20Input%20Box&color=e67700)  |                                       where you enter your commands to use PennyWise                                       |
| ![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=Command%20Output%20Box&color=d9480f) |                                  where you see the output of your commands from PennyWise                                  |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Warning**
If the application is resized to a smaller screen, certain graphical components will no longer be visible. This is to ensure that
that you are still able to get an overview of your finances. If these details are important, use PennyWise in fullscreen!

1. Pie Chart Legend <br/>
- The Pie Chart Legend would not be visible should the application be of a smaller size. This ensures your categorical overview
  can still be seen at a glance!
  ![ChartLegend](images/ug/ChartLegend.png)

2. Line Graph Dates
- Certain Line Graph dates would not be visible should the application be of a smaller size. This ensures you are still
  able to view the linear trend of your entries can still be seen.
  ![LineGraphDates](images/ug/LineGraphDates.png)
</div>

## Understanding the command formats
All commands follow this format except: [`delete`](#deleting-entries--delete-index_of_entry-tentry_type), 
[`clear`](#clearing-all-entries--clear), [`exit`](#exiting-the-program--exit) and `help`.<br>
<pre>
    command | entry identifier | input | [optional inputs]
</pre>

For example, given the command `add t/e d/Lunch a/15.60 da/15-08-2022 c/Food`, let us decompose the command format step-by-step!

|      Format      |                Example                 |
|:----------------:|:--------------------------------------:|
|     Command      |                 `add`                  |
| Entry Identifier |                 `t/e`                  |
|      Input       | `d/Lunch a/15.60 da/15-08-2022 c/Food` |
|  Optional Input  |                  NIL                   |

- Letters followed by a forward slash is called a prefix and will be used to specify a specific parameter<br>
  e.g `t/ ` refers to the entry type parameter.

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters that you must supply<br>
  e.g. In `delete INDEX_OF_ENTRY t/ENTRY_TYPE`, `INDEX_OF_ENTRY` is a parameter which can be used as `delete 10 t/e`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `view t/ENTRY_TYPE [MONTH]` can be used as `view t/e mo/2022-05` or as `view t/e`.

- **ALL** identifiers are <ins>case-sensitive</ins>.
  e.g `d/Lunch` as a descriptor for "Lunch" is accepted by PennyWise, however `D/Lunch` would not be accepted.

### Categorising your expenses and income

For **ALL** entries, categories are <ins>COMPULSORY</ins> and every entry can only contain <ins>one</ins> category.
  The following table shows the`Expenditure` and `Income` entries categories. The category names are <ins>case-insensitive</ins>.

|   `Expenditure`   |    `Income`     |
|:-----------------:|:---------------:|
|     **Food**      |   **Salary**    |
|   **Groceries**   |  **Allowance**  |
| **Entertainment** |   **Profit**    |
|   **Education**   | **Investments** |
|    **Housing**    |    **Gifts**    |
|    **Others**     |   **Others**    |

For example, an expense entry can be tagged with `Food`, but not `Salary`.

### Guidelines on organising your expenses and income

For **ALL** entries, 2 entries are considered duplicates <ins>IF</ins> both entries have exactly the same:
`description`, `date` `amount` and `category`. We do not want PennyWise to be managing entries which are a repeat,
of one another, as it would be easier to simply use the [edit](#editing-entries-edit-index_of_entry-tentry_type-dedited_description-aedited_amount-daedited_date-cedited_category)
command to alter the original entry's specifications.

In addition `description` and  `food` are case-insensitive, this means that `FOOD` will be equivalent to `food`

For example, when executing the following [add commands](#adding-entries-add-tentry_type-ddescription-aamount-dadate-ccategory) one after another,
PennyWise will recognise (2), which is the second `Teh Beng` added as a duplicate entry.

<pre>
    <code>
        1. add t/e d/Teh Beng a/1.50 da/22-10-2022 c/food
        2. add t/e d/teh beng a/1.50 da/22-10-2022 c/Food
    </code>
</pre>

To add similar entries, vary the description/amount/date/category to let PennyWise know they are not duplicates!

<pre>
    <code>
        1. add t/e d/Teh Beng 11am a/1.50 da/22-10-2022 c/Food
        2. add t/e d/Teh Beng 4pm a/1.50 da/22-10-2022 c/Food
    </code>
</pre>

OR we could even [edit](#editing-entries-edit-index_of_entry-tentry_type-dedited_description-aedited_amount-daedited_date-cedited_category) the original entry directly to reflect 2 cups of `Teh Beng` consumed.

<pre>
    <code>
        1. edit 1 t/e d/2 Teh Beng 11am a/3.00 da/22-10-2022 c/Food
    </code>
</pre>


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info:**
Having multiple duplicate entries will make it difficult for you to track your expenses later on, and could clutter the list.
Having them differentiated will make it easier for you to recall what you spent your money on!
